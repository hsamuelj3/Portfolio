# My Robotics and Software Development Portfolio

This repository will grow to contain various projects demonstrating skills in robotics, simulations, optimization techniques, and more.

## Current Sections

### Controls

This folder contains demonstrations of control theory. Currently they are implemented on a "blockbeam" system, and next an inverted pendulum.

The control theories used will be basic PID/PD, state feedback with an observer and/or disturbance observer, model predictive control (MPC), and sliding mode control (SMC), all with various modifications and flairs to demonstrate different capabilities.

## Future sections

The following sections describe topics I have worked on in the past and have not yet uploaded, as well as topics I would like to work on for this portfolio.

### Simulations

Simulating physical phenomena or anything I find interesting, e.g. Nonlinear disease spread representation, the double pendulum, etc..

### Optimization Techniques

Various techniques including quadratic programming will be used to solve unique problems including a passion project of theoretical railroad stop planning in the United States of America.

### ROS2 Projects

Having worked on various projects before I want to remake them to be configured using Docker to allow easy running on any device. Things like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), LiDAR, navigation, and more will be demonstrated.

Other future projects will include exploration of packages like ardupilot for the task of autonomous navigation, as well as more simple programs of demonstrating my Controls projects using c++ instead of python.
